- perhaps that is one rather for @Wei but we urgently need to set up
additional email addresses askusanything@octo.productions (that we link to
under each text) and one that is just mail@octo.productions that we can use
to register the PayPal business account, and they should both redirect
emails to our personal accounts if possible.

- then i can set up the Paypal asap and we can get the payment page ready,
i just don't want people to have to donate to raoul@octo or stefan@octo,
because that would send the wrong message.
